# Simple BlockChain Implementation in C++
This is a simple implementation of Blockchain in C++
Since blockchains use cryptography, now would be a good time to get some cryptographic functionality in our blockchain. Weâ€™re going to be using the SHA256 hashing technique to create hashes of our blocks.
