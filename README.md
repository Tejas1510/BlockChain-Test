# Simple BlockChain Implementation in C++
This is a basic implementation of Blockchain in C++.
Since blockchains use cryptography, this repo uses some cryptographic functionality in our blockchain. We have used the SHA256 hashing technique to create hashes of our blocks.
Feel free to fork the repo and make the changes you think are missing!
